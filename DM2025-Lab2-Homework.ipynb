    "For this lab we have divided the assignments into **three phases/parts**. The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "1. **Emoji to Text Conversion**: Emojis carry strong emotional signals (e.g., 😀 indicates joy, 😢 indicates sadness). Instead of removing them, we convert emojis to their text descriptions (e.g., 😀 → \"grinning_face\") to preserve this valuable emotional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **URL and Mention Removal**: URLs (http://...) and @mentions (@username) are noise that don't contribute to emotion detection, so we remove them from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contraction Expansion**: Contractions like \"won't\", \"can't\", and \"I'm\" are expanded to their full forms (\"will not\", \"cannot\", \"I am\") to standardize the text and improve tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stopword Removal**: Common words like \"the\", \"is\", \"at\" appear frequently but carry little emotional meaning. However, we preserve negation words (\"not\", \"no\", \"never\") as they significantly impact sentiment (e.g., \"not happy\" vs \"happy\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Lemmatization**: Words are reduced to their base dictionary form (e.g., \"running\" → \"run\", \"happier\" → \"happy\"). This reduces vocabulary size and groups related words together, improving model generalization."
