    **Page 1** &quot;&quot;&quot; Review by andrewburgereviews – The Godfather It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&#x27;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me. <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This film works so well</span> because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it</span>. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It is also the reason why it&#x27;s so welcoming</span>. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men</span>. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well- thought out actions</span>. But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge</span>. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it&#x27;s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He is a man defined by moral principles</span>. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter&#x27;s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I could not help but sympathize both of them</span> only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit- man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line</span>. The more I watched the more I realized <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it</span>. The best example is Corleone&#x27;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He returns home for his sister&#x27;s wedding as a war hero dressed the part</span> &quot;&quot;&quot; **Page 2** &quot;&quot;&quot; with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the change is shocking</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.</span>  Inside, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice.</span> Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.</span>  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This is a film of unmatched subtlety.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">No other movie sustains itself as good.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness.</span> There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I felt them.</span> What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.</span>  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions.</span> &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Godfather</span>&quot; is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.</span> &quot;&quot;&quot;
